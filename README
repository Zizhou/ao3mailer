Backend for some silly chrome extension that probably already exists, but in a 
better, more generic form.

Single purpose! Gets a story url from archiveofourown.org, gets the .mobi 
download, and sends it to the provided email(preferably kindle).

Hell, I don't think this will even have a frontend beyond the extension.

Dependencies:
none, for now
